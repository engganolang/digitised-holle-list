## Introduction {#sec-intro}

The Holle List (hereafter HL) consists of approximately 1000 lexical items designed by K. F. Holle (1829-1896), an "eminent authority and lover of the Netherlands Indies and their people" [@holleli1980, 1]. The HL was prepared to be dispersed across the Indonesian archipelago to gather knowledge about the linguistic situation of Indonesia, the then Dutch colony.

The HL exists in three variants (versions 1894, 1904/1911, and 1931) differing slightly in content and the order of the items. The HL in this [`engganolang`](https://github.com/engganolang/digitised-holle-list) GitHub repository is the "new basic list (NBL)" set up by Stokhof [-@holleli1980, 17, 22-72] "to facilitate comparative work" across the three different variants of the HL (see @fig-table for the interactive version and the [raw file here](https://github.com/engganolang/digitised-holle-list/blob/main/data/digitised-holle-list-in-stokhof-1980.tsv)). The NBL captures all lexical items appearing in the three variants of the HL, except those items "which never or hardly ever appeared to be filled in by the researchers" [@holleli1980, 17]. These exception items appear as footnotes in the word list of each target language.

## The rationale for the digitisation of the Holle List {#sec-rational}

The publication of the three variants of the Holle List as the new basic list (NBL) in Stokhof [-@holleli1980] is available as an [open-access PDF](https://core.ac.uk/reader/159464813) file under the [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license (license provided in the footer of the cover page in the PDF file). While the PDF itself is searchable via the basic find functionality in a PDF viewer, the list is obviously not manipulatable (e.g., when we want to filter certain items). It also cannot facilitate computational processing to automatically match the IDs of the list with the ID of the vocabulary in the target languages.

Given that the CC-BY license allows us to copy, adapt and build upon the material for any purpose, as long as we provide attribution (i.e., citation) to the original material, we decided to digitise the NBL into a fully searchable, portable format (i.e., a UTF-8 encoded, tab-separated plain text) (see @fig-table for the interactive version). The digitisation is conducted in conjunction with our AHRC-funded project to build lexical resources for Enggano ("Lexical resources for Enggano, a threatened language of Indonesia", <https://enggano.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/>). The project, amongst others, aims at bringing together a host of historical, paper-born resources available for Enggano. The Enggano vocabularies in the Holle List is one of the oldest ones from the late 19^th^ century [collected in 1895 by Abs vd Noord: see @stokhof-1987, 189].

## Content of the digitised Holle List {#sec-content}

The digitised, NBL Holle List (HL) preserves the original columns, with the renaming of the columns containing the years for the three versions of the Holle List so that these columns do not begin with numbers. Note that the first four columns are not labelled in the original PDF. These columns here are the `Index`, `Dutch`, `English`, and `Indonesian`. The Indonesian glosses were taken from the 1931 version of the HL [@holleli1980, 18]. It is the values in the `Index` column that can be computationally matched with the Index in the (also digitised) word lists of the target languages (published as subsequent volumes after Stokhof [-@holleli1980]).

We added several new columns after the version years columns. One of these is the `Swadesh` columns (Boolean `true`/`false`), indicating whether the entries are part of the Swadesh items (`true`) or not (`false`) listed in Stokhof [-@holleli1980, 141-143]. From this table, it is then possible to easily filter out the Swadesh items, something that is not possible in the PDF version, since the NBL table does not directly include a column marking which items are from the Swadesh list; we then hand-coded this Swadesh column.

An additional column after the `Swadesh` column is the `Swadesh_orig` column. It lists the English forms/labels given in the Swadesh appendix [@holleli1980, 141-143], which could be phrased differently in the `English` column in the NBL. When the forms in the `Swadesh` and the `English` columns are exact matches, the `Swadesh_orig` column is left empty. Moreover, typo corrections were done for the entries of the three language columns (either typo from the original PDF or typo due to the first-pass OCR error) (listed in the `Remark` column).

We hope that the digitised NBL of the Holle List can be helpful for, and escalate the workflow of, other researchers with computational orientation. Readers/users are also encouraged to check the original PDF list in Stokhof [-@holleli1980].
