Annotating this kinship relation is tricky (maybe because the abbreviation in the glossing)


In deciding the concept set, looking at the synonym of the "Description in source" is also performed. For example, on deciding the concept set for "coconut shell" (marked ??? by pyconcepticon), I look at description which contains 'hull', which is the outer covering of a fruit or seed. This is slightly more specific outer cover than SHELL, which is designated for animal.

Moreover, there are cases where the generic concept is used (i.e., the hypernym) over the more specific concepts (i.e., the hyponym) when the latter are not available. (cf. FLOUR)
